# Aims

The goal of this project is to reproduce the following visualization
from The Economist:

![](Economist1.png)

This chart is a scatterplot using data from 2011. The x-axis displays
the Corruption Perceptions Index, where 10 is least corrupt. The y-axis
has the Human Development Index, where 1 is highest development. Points
are colored by region.

Using the data provided, I want to reproduce this plot. I'm also
wondering if there may be some way to improve it. The data is pretty
simplistic. There's an index that ranges from 1-10 on the x-axis, and
there's an index ranging from 0-1 on the y-axis. Countries are colored
by region. The curve is also pretty straightforward. As data
visualizations go, this is pretty solid.

## Packages Used

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggthemes)
```

# Following the Notes

In the Udemy course I took this project from, there's a notebook
available with step by step instructions on how to recreate this to a
certain point. For the first part of this, I'll be following those. I'm
including that with no comments.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/Alex/Documents/online_courses/R-Course-HTML-Notes/R-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/Training Exercises/Capstone and Data Viz Projects/Data Visualization Project")
```

```{r read_data}
df <- read_csv("Economist_Assignment_Data.csv") %>% data.table()

df %>% head()
```

The visualization I'm trying to reproduce plots CPI against HDI.

```{r initial_scatter}
pl <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + geom_point()

pl
```

```{r plot_shapes}
pl <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 4, stroke = 1.4, fill = "white")

pl
```

```{r smooth_plot}
pl + geom_smooth(aes(group = 1))
```

```{r fix_line}
pl2 <- pl + geom_smooth(
  aes(group = 1),
  method = lm,
  formula = y ~ log(x),
  se = F,
  color = "red"
)

pl2
```

```{r add_names}
pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country))
```

```{r add_limited_names}
point_list <- c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
                   "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil",
                   "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spane",
                   "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France",
                   "United States", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", "Japan",
                   "New Zealand", "Singapore")

pl3 <- pl2 + geom_text(aes(label = Country), data = df %>% filter(Country %in% point_list), color = "gray20") + lims(x = c(0,10), y = c(0.2,1))

pl3
```

```{r change_theme}
pl4 <- pl3 + theme_minimal()

pl4
```

Fix the axes to fall more in line with the original chart.

```{r add_titles}
pl5 <- pl4 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:10, 
    name = "Corruption Perception Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)", 
    limits = c(1,10.5)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = 2:10/10, 
    limits = c(0.2, 1), 
    name = "Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)")

pl6 <- pl5 + ggtitle("Corruption and Human Development")

pl6
```

That's the end of the project in the notes, but there are ways to
improve this, I think.

# Getting Even Closer

The main differences between the original plot and the one I created in
the previous section are aesthetic. The axis labels are right, and the
points and everything are in the right place. However, this whole thing
looks really busy and cluttered. The legend takes too much space along
the side, forcing the x-axis to contract. The labels of the countries
with names plotted are illegible.

I think I can do better.

I'll start by creating a color palette from the original plot. I used
the Mac app Color Slurp to grab the hex codes for these from the
original image.

```{r palette}
economist_palette <- c("#17546A",
  "#17A5DB",
  "#81D6F6",
  "#1D948B",
  "#F25341",
  "#82311B",
  "#EF231F")
```

Now, I'll adjust the grid lines to more closely mirror the ones used by
The Economist. I'll fix the coloring and ordering of the smoothed line,
too. In the original plot, the smoothed line is the bottom layer. Points
and names are mapped on top of that. I'll fix mine to do the same. I'll
also move the legend to use a single row across the top.

```{r fix_grid_lines}
pl7 <- pl6 + theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
            axis.line.x = element_line(color = "gray20"),
            axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(color = "gray20"),
            axis.ticks.length.x = unit(-1.4, "mm"),
            legend.position = "top",
            legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  geom_smooth(
    aes(group = 1),
    method = lm,
    formula = y ~ log(x),
    se = FALSE,
    color = economist_palette[7]
  ) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 4, stroke = 1.5, fill = "white") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = Country), data = df %>% filter(Country %in% point_list), color = "gray20") + 
  lemon::coord_capped_cart(bottom = "left") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = economist_palette)

pl7
```

The point sizes are still too big. They don't allow you to really
appreciate the individual nations. The names also need to move.

```{r}
pl8 <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region)) + 
  geom_smooth(
    aes(group = 1),
    method = lm,
    formula = y ~ log(x),
    se = FALSE,
    color = economist_palette[7]
  ) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2, stroke = 1.3, fill = "white") + 
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = Country), 
    data = df %>% filter(Country %in% point_list),
    color = "grey20",
    fill = "white", 
    alpha = 0.95,
    box.padding = 0.8,
    point.padding = 0.5,
    direction = "both") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:10, 
    name = "Corruption Perception Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)", 
    limits = c(1,10.5)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = 2:10/10, 
    limits = c(0.2, 1), 
    name = "Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)") + 
  ggtitle("Corruption and Human Development") + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
            axis.line.x = element_line(color = "gray20"),
            axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(color = "gray20"),
            axis.ticks.length.x = unit(-1.4, "mm"),
            legend.position = "top",
            legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  lemon::coord_capped_cart(bottom = "left") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = economist_palette)

pl8
```

# Final Result

Now, I've got a nearly exact reproduction of the original plot.
